# Project goals

1. Learn rust by building something remotely real
2. Build something useful for the $SOL community
3. OSS the code for future rust learners

# Project description

sol.wtf is a simple resource for anyone short on time to quickly get up to date on the $SOL
ecosystem. It aggregates the top posts from Twitter / Reddit / other
[Solana-relevant platfroms](https://solana.com/community).

What's the difference with eg just using Twitter? Twitter wants you to spend
as MUCH time on their website as possible and so even if you follow the right
people your timeline will be optimized in a way to waste your time. 

sol.wtf is the opposite of that. We want you to spend as LITTLE time on the
website as possible. So we surface the top posts first and you can keep
scrolling for as much (or little) as you want. From personal experirence checking the
website once a day for 2-3min is sufficient to stay in the loop.
